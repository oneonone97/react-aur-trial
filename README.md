# React 

1. Created the React app by using Create React App and Vite
2. Created a custom react app. In this understood the basics how React works under the hood, how createElement works in React.
3. Created a counter app and used hooks naming useState() and it takes only two values in an array. First index is variable and second index is a function.
4. useState() second index i.e the function update the state but doesn't return the updated value directly it return undefined i.e console.log(< secondIndex of useState() >) will display undefined.
5. Hooks basically update the UI simultaneously if the changes are occuring in multiple positions.
